A skeleton for a Python package
===============================

This repository provides a skeleton of a Python package.  It is useful
as a starting point to create a new package.


System requirements
-------------------

Python:

+ Python 3.4 or newer.

Required library packages:

+ None

Optional library packages:

+ `setuptools_scm`_

  The version number is managed using this package.  All source
  distributions add a static text file with the version number and
  fall back using that if `setuptools_scm` is not available.  So this
  package is only needed to build out of the plain development source
  tree as cloned from GitHub.
